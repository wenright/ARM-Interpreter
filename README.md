# ARM-Interpreter
An interpreter for ARM assembly

## Build

Make sure you have yacc and flex installed first, then just type

``` console
make
```

## Usage
``` console
./interpreter tests/helloworld.s
```

#### Note
There are still a lot of things that don't work at all.  This isn't mean to be a complete interpreter, it can only run very simple programs.
